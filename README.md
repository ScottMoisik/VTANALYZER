# VTANALYZER
Custom MATLAB tool for landmarking vocal tract image data

## Installation and Demo

Download and extract the code into a convenient folder. In MATLAB, browse to the folder you extracted VTANALYZER into so that it is the current folder. In the MATLAB Command Window, type `vtanalyzer`, which will load the VTANALYZER tool. A demo `DCB` (DICOM blob) file has been included for convenience. You can double click on this file in the `Raw Data Files` list or load it using the menuing system (via `File > Open Raw Data > Filter for *.DCB`). A demo `LMD` (landmark data) file `demo_landmarks.lmd` with a single landmark has also been included for convenience.
